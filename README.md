A session will display images, while maintaining their original aspect ratio, according to the schedule with image navigation that maintains its respective schedule configuration.

# Note
Current supported file types: .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .png. Settings are stored using the shelve module, and are saved in the folders 'presets' and 'recent' as .bak, .dat, and .dir files. These folders are saved in the same directory as GestureSesh.exe. The most recent images, randomization setting, and schedule used will be automatically loaded when reopening GestureSesh.exe. 

Updates are checked every other day (if the app was opened), and a notice will be displayed if there is one.
